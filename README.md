# Maps of COVID-19 Cases in the United States in 2020

In this lab assignment, I create thematic maps depicting COVID-19 cases in the U.S. using HTML progamming and Mapbox functions. Mapbox is a useful tool in creating interactive web map applications with unique design features and an easy-to-learn interface. The data COVID-19 cases and deaths data were collected by the New York Times. U.S. Population and geometeries data originates from the 2018 ACS 5-year estimates gathered by the U.S. Census Bureau.

The first map is an interactive choropleth map that displays counts of positive COVID-19 cases at the county-level in the United States. Darker shades of red/orange shows a higher volume of COVID-19 cases, while lighter colored areas mean less. Hovering over any county will provide a pop-up window where you can see specifics on that county, such as the populations, positve cases, rate, and deaths. The legend also provides informations on how each color represents a certain number within an interval of positive cases. 

[COVID-19 Proportional Symbols Map](https://jpalag.github.io/covidmaps2020/map2.html)

The second map is an interactive proportional symbol map that uses circles varying in size and color to depict the magnitude of COVID-19 cases in that area. The legend displays what each size circle represents. Smaller circles are lower COVID-19 rates, while larger circles are higher rates.
